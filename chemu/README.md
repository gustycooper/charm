# Chemu
Chemu is the Charm emulator. Chemu executes Charm "binary" code. Chemu has a collection of commands that allows the user to step single assembly instructions, step multiple assembly instructions, set breakpoints, examine/modify registers, and examine/modify memory. Explanations for using Cheumu are provided in the [Charm Wiki](https://github.com/gustycooper/charm/wiki). If you prefer to read a contiguous document, you can at [Charm Guide](https://gusty.bike/charm.html).
