# Chlink
Chlink is the Charm linker. Chlink combines muliple Charm .o files into an executable a_out.o file. At this time the linker can be used to demonstrate the concepts of linking `.o` files into an executable. I have not used it much. Explanations for using Chlink are provided in the [Charm Wiki](https://github.com/gustycooper/charm/wiki). If you prefer to read a contiguous document, you can at [Charm Guide](https://gusty.bike/charm.html).
