# Charm
Charm defines an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and tools for learning assembly programming and operating system concepts. I created Charm to teach assembly programming in a computer architecture course at the University of Mary Washington. Several students have contributed to Charm. Lauren Knight developed Charmweb, Matt Nguyen developed portions of chaos, and Josh Cottrell developed preprocessing algorithms for chasm. Charm has a collection of C code that implements a toolchain (assembler with preprocessor, emulator, linker, and C compiler) for programming and running Charm programs. The Charm toolchain can be built and run on Linux or MacOS. If you are a Windows computer user, you can install Windows Subystem for Linux and run the Charm toolchain. 
* The [Charm Wiki](https://github.com/gustycooper/charm/wiki) contains documentation describing Charm. 
* If you prefer to read a contiguous document instead of a Wiki, you can at [Charm Guide](https://gusty.bike/charm.html).
* The [Charm Assembly Reference Card](https://github.com/gustycooper/charm/blob/main/charmcard.pdf) (included in the home space of the Charm repo) can be printed double-sided and used as a handy reference for Charm assembly programming. When I worked in the 1970's, 1980's, and 1990's, I often had an assembly reference cards that I used. The Charm Assembly Reference is a throwback to those I used.
