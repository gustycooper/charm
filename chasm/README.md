# Chasm
Chasm is the Charm assembler. Chasm translates Charm assembly language into "binary" that can be excuted using Chemu, the Charm emulator. The definition of Charm assembly language and how to use Chasm is defined in the [Charm Wiki](https://github.com/gustycooper/charm/wiki). If you prefer to read a contiguous document, you can at [Charm Guide](https://gusty.bike/charm.html). Josh Cottrell developed preprocessing algorithms for chasm.
