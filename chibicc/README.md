# chibicc for Charm

Rui Ueyama's official chibicc is located on GitHub

I modified chibicc to generate Charm assembly code. Charm is a teaching tool that consits of an ISA, assembly language, assembler, and emulator. With chibicc, Charm also has a C compiler.

chibicc is a full-blown C compiler that implements most C11 features and can compile several real-world applications. At this time, Charm and chibicc supports integers. 

Rui's is writing a book to accompany chibicc. The book is about the C compiler and the low-level programming.  If you like chibicc, please consider purchasing a copy of the book when it becomes available!

Rui's GitHub describes pronouncing chibicc as _chee bee cee cee_. "chibi" means "mini" or "small" in Japanese. "cc" stands for C compiler.
