# Chibicc
Chibicc is the Charm C compiler. Chibicc translates C code to Charm assembly (or Charm binary). I modified [Rui Ueyamm's chibicc](https://github.com/rui314/chibicc) to generate Charm Assembly. For the most part, `chibicc` works, but the generated code follows a stack machine and does not efficiently use the registers. At this time chibicc is more of a novelty. Someday, I may improve the code generator and use it for develop chaos. More information about Chibicc are provided in the [Charm Wiki](https://github.com/gustycooper/charm/wiki). If you prefer to read a contiguous document, you can at [Charm Guide](https://gusty.bike/charm.html).
